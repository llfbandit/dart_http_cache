## 4.0.5
- chore: Updated dependencies.

## 4.0.4
- fix: Allow keyBuilder to depend on request body.

## 4.0.3
- fix: BaseRequest now has `headers` getter instead of `headerValuesAsList`.
- chore: Updated dependencies.

## 4.0.2
- fix: Missing exports to handle client only caching.

## 4.0.1
- fix: Improve cache save time.
- fix: `CacheOptions#maxStale` usage may lead to empty response body.
- feat: Improve performance on cache check when using cipher.

## 4.0.0
- chore: Reworked package to be only a `dio` interceptor. Leaving space to do the same with `http` package or others.
- feat: ** __BREAKING__ ** Stores save response status codes.
  - Store migration is implicit, you have nothing to do.
  - 304 may still be forwarded for older cached responses.
- feat: ** __BREAKING__ ** `hitCacheOnErrorExcept` is split with `hitCacheOnNetworkFailure`. Term is now positive and replaced by `hitCacheOnErrorCodes`.
- feat: Add `hitCacheOnNetworkFailure` to allow restore previous cached response on network failure (connection, TO, ...).
- chore: Stores are now fully agnostic and don't rely on `dio_cache_interceptor` package.
- chore: Source code cleanup.
- chore: Min SDK is now 3.0.0.
- chore: Updated dependencies.

## 3.5.1
- fix: Allow `"` in header values.
- chore: Some more tests added.
- chore: Updated README.md.

## 3.5.0
- chore: Updated dependencies.
- chore: Updated example.
- feat: Isar added as store.
- feat: Status 304 is now managed when set as valid status.

## 3.4.4
- chore: Allow UUID package version v4.x

## 3.4.3
- fix: Correctly serialize null content responses.
- chore: explicitly allow dart 3.
- chore: Now requires Dio >= 5.2.0+1.

## 3.4.2
- fix: Headers were not saved/restored in/from `CacheResponse`.
- fix: Cache trigger now enabled again with `expires`, `Cache-Control`/`max-age`.
- feat: Add few new status codes available for caching: 404, 405 and 501.
- chore: Few code improvements.

## 3.4.1
- chore: Ensure header values are join when there's comma (,) in the value (date, expires, last-modified, etag).
Dio may or may not understand headers with single value (i.e.: 'Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT').

## 3.4.0
- chore: Allow dio version 5 aside version 4.

## 3.3.1
- fix: pathExists queryParams are not checked correctly (thanks to @clragon)

## 3.3.0
- feat: Add `Store.getFromPath` method.
- feat: Add `Store.deleteFromPath` method.  
Those two methods allow advanced manipulation of entries in store.  
Ensure to be restrictive when using it.

## 3.2.7
- fix: read/write when cipher is used.
- core: Avoids some roundtrips resulting in improved performance.
- feat: (Re-)introduce `copyWith` on `CacheResponse`.
- core: Remove Android example deprecations.

## 3.2.6
- feat: Don't skip subsequent `onResponse` interceptors if any.

## 3.2.5
- fix: Cache control parsing on request. Dio request headers are not of type `Headers`.

## 3.2.4
- fix: Missing `Nullable` export.

## 3.2.3
- __Breaking__ feat: `CacheOptions.copyWith` now requires `Nullable` for some parameters to allow `null` values.
- fix: Since version 3.2.0, when `maxStale` was set on global options, it was necessary to re-create the dedicated `CacheOptions` for the request to avoid postponing. You can now use the changed copyWith to do that.
- fix: `MemCacheStore.close` now clears all entries.
- fix: size computation of entry bytes in `MemCacheStore`.

## 3.2.2
- fix: stream response type is no more eligible to cache (wasn't working anyway). This is additional fix to `content-disposition: attachment; ...` since headers may not be set.

## 3.2.1
- fix: io import in CacheResponse preventing usage with web platform.

## 3.2.0
>Warning, this version is considered compatible with previous versions about stored data.  
>However, cache store entries have now a new field for request
>date persistence which is setup arbitrarily for backward compatibility (150ms before response receive time).  
>Depending of your usage, cache beheviour could be a bit inaccurate while entries are not updated with new strategy algorithm.  
>If this is critical for your app, consider to clean up your store by calling `store.clean();` for example on your next app upgrade.

- feat: More status codes (203, 301) are available for caching responses.
- feat: Status codes (302 are 307) are available for caching responses under strict conditions.
- feat: Lots of improvements in computation of response expiry. Package is now much more compliant with `rfc7234`.
- feat: `age`, `max-stale`, `min-fresh`, `must-revalidate` headers/values are now parsed.
- feat: When `maxStale` is given to the request, interceptor will now add/update it from the current date for a previously cached response. This lets you get more control to postpone the deletion if needed.
- fix: stale state is now handled in interceptor instead of cache stores.
- fix: `no-cache` header is now correctly handled.
- fix: `content-disposition: attachment; ...` is no more eligible to be cached.
- core: General code cleanup to handle above features.
